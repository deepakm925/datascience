##Building a Student Intervention System
Supervised Learning Project

###Description

This project involves building a model to predict how likely a student will pass their high school final exam using a small dataset containing information about 395 students.  This is a supervised classification problem, which requires the weighing of several classification methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbor to see which one yielded the highest F1 score and minimizing computational costs.  

###Software and Libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- iPython Notebook
