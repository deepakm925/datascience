# Project Description

Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims.  In this notebook, you will get to see how I achieved a top 28% on the private leaderboard for this challenge.  

## Requirements

### Dataset

The dataset needs to be downloaded from the [Kaggle competition's page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data)

### Software

Downloading the latest version of Anaconda should come installed with either Python 2.7 or 3.0, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. For some of the cell blocks to work, you will need to install the other libraries. I've provided the necessary links.

* Python 2.7 or 3.0
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* XGBoost
* Bayesian Optimization
