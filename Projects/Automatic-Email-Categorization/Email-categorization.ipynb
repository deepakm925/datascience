    "The Enron corpus is the largest public domain database of real e-mails in the world.  This version of the dataset contains over 500,000 emails from about 150 users, mostly senior management at Enron.  The corpus is valuable for research in that it provides a rich example of how a real organization uses e-mails and has had a widespread influence on today's software for fraud detection.  Visit [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) to learn more about the Enron scandal.  \n",

One way to do this is by using something called a [**Bag-of-words model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model).  It will take the e-mails as a string and convert it into a numerical vector to show the frequency that each unique word appears over the entire dataset.  The first step in creating a Bag-of-words model is called tokenization.  By tokenizing each e-mail, each string is split into a list of words. "

the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc)\\ngeneral partner.  the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nland ownership & loans\\nthe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nall loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nuse of initial investment\\nthe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\ncreekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nearly land costs\\nthe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nequity at improvement loan\\nonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nthe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nphasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nconstruction loans\\nthere are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nspec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\ndisbursements\\ndisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner\\nwill contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the\\nfee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nthese fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nfinally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nreporting\\nwe

lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due\\nto a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.\\nwe do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of\\nthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  this would produce an average sq\\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (i thought his\\nsales price was $187,000.)  at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\\nfor $203,108.\\nwhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\\nrent-ability.  you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\\nevaluation.  as for rent-ability, i believe that we have shown that the\\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    in fact, if we\\nwere able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom\\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\\nphillip, i will call you today to go over this more

\"larry lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \\nsubject: westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls\\n\\n\\nenclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin\\nthat we told you about.  as you can tell from the proforma this project\\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\\nthis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\\naustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\\nthis market.  this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\\nhave uncovered to date in the austin market.\\nthe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  as\\nit is in the \"smart growth corridor\" area designated by the city of austin\\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\\nin less than 6 months.  additionally, many of the current and more severe\\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  i have estimated the lot\\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north\\naustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\\nwidening.  even though this property is not likely to require street\\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\\nrequirement, i used this data to be cautious.\\n the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  other projects have been quite\\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\\nadjoining single family residential and a project at st. edwards university.\\nas with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\\nis uneven.  we have included a fence around the entire property, but may\\nonly put it on westgate and cameron loop.  gated communities are far\\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\\npreferences.\\nthe seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\\nan extended escrow.  this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\\nan a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\\nthis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\\nprofits of the project.  as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss\\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\\nwith your profit in the lot.  i believe this would facilitate the use of a\\n1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\\nbe the equity for that project.  you would need to discuss this with an\\nexchange expert first.  larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san\\nantonio if you do not know anyone.\\ni will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\\nby airborne express today for saturday delivery.\\nonce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  please get back to me as soon as\\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\\ntime.  you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\\n512-338-1103.   i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\\ni regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\\nevents these past few weeks.  a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\\ndowndrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes.\\none of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\\nstart the next day.  the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\\nto knock it down.  the city shut down the project for a week and it took\\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  then last week i had to take\\nmy wife  to emergency.  she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\\npast week..  there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   fortunately, it looks as\\nif she will be ok in the long run.\\ngeorge w. richards\\ncreekside builders, llc\\n\\n\\n - westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls\\n',

\\ncomputer servers for the\\n                  region\\'s growing number of dot-coms. \\n\\n                       fast-forward to summer 2000. exodus is now wrapping up \\nconstruction\\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\na mile from its\\n                  original facility. sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones, the\\n                  exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house internet servers for firms such as avenue a, \\nmicrosoft and onvia.com. \\n\\n                       exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near seattle.\\n                  more than a dozen companies -- with names like abovenet, \\nglobix and\\n                  hostpro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the internet economy. \\n\\n                       it is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite web sites.\\n\\n                       data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms, are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent \\nvalley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and \\npuget sound\\n                  energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities. \\n\\n                       \"we

business, \\nthe rise of the internet\\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\nheads. \\n\\n                       puget sound energy last week asked the washington \\nutilities and\\n                  transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers. the\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\nmillion each,\\n                  karzmar said. \\n\\n                       not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to \\nbring up the data center\\n                  issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting. \\n\\n                       for the utilities that provide power to homes, \\nbusinesses and schools in the\\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n\\n                       on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. the \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures. \\n\\n                       who will pay for those expenditures and what it will

       square-foot intergate east facility last september from \\nboeing space &\\n                  defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n92 percent of the\\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \\ncompanies. \\n\\n                       \"it is probably the largest data center park in the \\ncountry,\" boasts laurent\\n                  poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg \\ncommunications,\\n                  netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama \\nnetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       after building exodus\\' first tukwila facility in 1997, \\nsabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       as more people access the internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       but it is not just seattle. the need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as texas and \\ncalifornia. \\n\\n                       exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nwhile companies\\n                  such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"we have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said steve porter, an account \\nexecutive at exodus in\\n                  seattle. \\n\\n                       the booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said seattle city light\\'s royer. \"the utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\"

the property across the street from the sagewood units in san marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units   the land is selling for  2 50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in west san marcos  which now has a moratorium on development   several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher  roughly  1 25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12 month lease and  1 30  1 40 psf if leased on a 12 month term  but by individual room   this property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects  just as the duplexes do now   if this project is of serious interest to you  please let me know as there is a very  very short window of opportunity   the equity requirement is not yet known  but it would be likely to be  300 000 to secure the land   i will know more on this question later today   sincerely   george w  richards

today   after reviewing the  agreement i find it isn t binding  as far as i can determine   it is  too vague and it doesn t sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would draft for a real estate  closing  but  of course  i could be  wrong      if this closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this document s validity      i will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what s there and  find out where i am with that and deal with this as  best i can    i guess i was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact  or  rather sort of a contract    this isn t either   i tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket   i  talked to a crim  atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn t  sound binding to him      i will go back to mine and phillip allen s  transaction and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is i  doubt that my signature  is even  needed to complete this transaction    i am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing    i really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and i don t want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn t  seem to be something required for a closing   in  the event you do need my  signature on something like this i would rather have  time to have it  reviewed before i accept it    brenda     ', 'chris    what is the latest with pg e   we have been

subject  westgate proforma phillip allen xls   enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin that we told you about   as you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40  per year over 3 years  this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market   this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the austin market  the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan   as it is in the  smart growth corridor  area designated by the city of austin for preferred development  this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months   additionally  many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived   i have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north austin  which included a detention retention and filtration pond and street widening   even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pond requirement  i used this data to be cautious   the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly   other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline  such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at st  edwards university  as with most infill projects  the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven   we have included a fence around the entire property  but may only put it on westgate and cameron loop   gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences  the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of  680 000 and an extended escrow   this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract  which will mean that we can close into an a d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan  this analysis shows your investment at  700 000 for a 50  interest in the profits of the project   as we discussed in san marcos  we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots  sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot   i believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project   you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first   larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone  i

south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes  one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day   the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof

  i was aware that regan lehman  the lot developer for the entire 70 lot duplex project  was selling his units in the  180 s   he does have a much lower basis in the lots than anyone else  but the prime differences are due to a  he is selling them during construction and b  they are smaller units  we do not know the exact size of each of his units  but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164 1302 sq ft  plan   this would produce an average sq footage of 1233  which would be  73 80 psf at  182 000    i thought his sales price was  187 000    at this price psf our 1 376 sf unit would sell for  203 108  what is more important  in my view  is a  the rental rate and b  the rent ability   you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation   as for rent ability  i believe that we have shown that the 3 bedroom  3 5 bath is strongly preferred in this market     in fact  if we were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3 bedroom plan  phillip  i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly  sincerely  george w  richards creekside builders  llc   ', '                       forwarded by phillip k allen

enron com  cc   larry lewter   retwell mail sanmarcos net   subject  westgate proforma phillip allen xls   enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin that we told you about   as you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40  per year over 3 years  this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market   this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the austin market  the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan   as it is in the  smart growth corridor  area designated by the city of austin for preferred development  this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months   additionally  many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived   i have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north austin  which included a detention retention and filtration pond and street widening   even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pond requirement  i used this data to be cautious   the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly   other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline  such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at st  edwards university  as with most infill projects  the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven   we have included a fence around the entire property  but may only put it on westgate and cameron loop   gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences  the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of  680 000 and an extended escrow   this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract  which will mean that we can close into an a d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan  this analysis shows your investment at  700 000 for a 50  interest in the profits of the project   as we discussed in san marcos  we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots  sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot   i believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project   you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first   larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone  i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker  by airborne express today for saturday delivery  once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma  we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area   please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time   you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512 338 1119 or 512 338 1110   my cell phone is 512 748 7495 and the fax is 512 338 1103    i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner  i regret that it took so long to get back to you  but we had some unusual events these past few weeks   a small freakish wind storm with severe 60 mpg downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes  one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day   the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down   the city shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract   then last week i had to take my wife  to emergency   she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week    there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday    fortunately  it looks as if she will be ok in the long run  george w  richards creekside

square foot data center in  tukwila                           the mission was to handle the internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region s growing number of dot coms

        on one hand  the data centers    with their amazing  appetite for power                      represent potentially lucrative business customers  the  facilities run 24 hours a                   day  seven days a week  and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream  on the other hand  they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures                           who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to
