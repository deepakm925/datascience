    "The Enron corpus is the largest public domain database of real e-mails in the world.  This version of the dataset contains over 500,000 emails from about 150 users, mostly senior management at Enron.  The corpus is valuable for research in that it provides a rich example of how a real organization uses e-mails and has had a widespread influence on today's software for fraud detection.  Visit [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) to learn more about the Enron scandal.  \n",

    "The purpose of this project is to explore the data to check for fraud and to see what sort of information was leaked in the e-mails.  Checkout the data set [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/).  "
